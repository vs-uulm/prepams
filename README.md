# PrePaMS: A Privacy-preserving Participant Management System

This repository contains source code artifacts, experiments, and results associated with our PETS'24 submission.
A publicly hosted test deployment can be accessed at http://j2cqrb6vkmz32gqjn3jvjge5rm64agwpykjgvnp2yo372voytrcehyad.onion/ (blinded for review and therefore only accessible via Tor), where anyone is able to explore our system using any device featuring a modern web browser.

## Repository Structure
 * [`shared/`](shared) - a rust-based webassembly module implementing the PrePaMS schema.
 * [`backend/`](backend) - the PrePaMS server application that interfaces with the PrePaMS web application.
 * [`frontend/`](frontend) - the main client-side source code of the PrePaMS web application.
 * [`evaluation/`](evaluation) - evaluation artifacts to reproduce our performance evluation results (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)).
 * [`results/`](results) - our evaluation results as reported in our submission.

## Abstract
> Taking part in surveys, experiments, and studies is often compensated by rewards to increase the number of participants and encourage attendance.
> While privacy requirements are usually considered for participation, privacy aspects of the reward procedure are mostly ignored.
> To this end, we introduce PrePaMS, an efficient participation management system that supports prerequisite checks and participation rewards in a privacy-preserving way.
> Our system organizes participations with potential (dis-)qualifying dependencies and enables secure reward payoffs.
> By leveraging a set of proven cryptographic primitives and mechanisms such as anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs, participations are protected so that service providers and organizers cannot derive the identity of participants even within the reward process.
> In this paper, we have designed and implemented a prototype of PrePaMS to show its effectiveness and evaluated its performance under realistic workloads.
> PrePaMS covers the information whether subjects have participated in surveys, experiments, or studies.
> When combined with other secure solutions for the actual data collection within these events, PrePaMS can represent a cornerstone for more privacy-preserving empirical research.

## Evaluation
To assess the practicability of our proof-of-concept prototype, we have evaluated the performance of the PrePaMS primitives.
The evaluation in this repository follows the [Popper convention](https://getpopper.io/) for reproducible evaluations.

### Reproducing Results
The Popper workflow in this repository can be used to replicate results, compute statistics, and generate a box plot from the evaluation results.
Assuming both [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the [Popper CLI tool](https://getpopper.io/) are installed, you can simply call `popper run` in the root directory of the repository to run the workflow.

Our Popper workflow (see [`.popper.yml`](.popper.yml)) consists of two steps:
 * `measure` - Uses puppeteer to log the time it takes to execute the synthetic workload of PrePaMS operations.
 * `analyze` - Computes basic statistics on the time data collected in the previous step and generates a box plot.

Post execution the [`evaluation/results/`](results) directory will contain the following files:
 * `performance/register.csv` - Measurements of the register protocol.
 * `performance/participations.csv` - Measurements of the participation protocol.
 * `performance/payout.csv` - Measurements of the payout protocol.
 * `plot.pdf` - A violin plot showing the processing times of the measured algorithms.
 * `scaling.pdf` - A min/max linechart showing the processing time of the participation protocol in relation to the number of qualifier and disqualifier.

### Measuring other Devices

The [`evaluation/`](evaluation/) directory also contains means to measure other devices, such as smartphones or tablets.
Executing `npm run build` compiles a static version of the performance evaluation and outputs it to the `evaluation/dist` directory.
Then [`evaluation/serve.js`](evaluation/serve.js) can be used to run a simple web server which hosts this static evaluation app, as well as an HTTP-based API to retrieve measurement results from other devices.
A ready to use version is deployed under http://j2cqrb6vkmz32gqjn3jvjge5rm64agwpykjgvnp2yo372voytrcehyad.onion/eval/ (blinded for review and hence only accessible through Tor for now), ready to to be used on any device featuring a modern browser.
